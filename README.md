**From-the-get-go**
===============

This is my intial step in learning how to code. 

My main goal it to try and integrate git/github to use as a writing tool to help integrate, manage, and publish my work through one application. I am looking at the possible ways I can manage to do this with my limited skill set. Looking what is available I have found the following applicatons:
	
    -Prose.io
    -Authorea
    -Penflip

There are other options that are available, but i think I will start with these to begin. Most likely I will not be using this extensively at first, but I believe if I can continue learning about these programs I can start to make my own. A solid project to start off with is to see if I can make something to the same spec as the above programs.

This will not be easy in the least. I will write about the process as I go along. I don't know how proficient I will be in maintaing a set schedule. But I will try to commit to publish as much as possible.
